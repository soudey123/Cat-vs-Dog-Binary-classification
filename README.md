# Cat-vs-Dog-Binary-classification
Implementation of Binary image classification using Tensorflow Keras.

This project demonstrtates the classfication on Cat vs Dog dataset using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)
We will use the dataset from https://storage.googleapis.com/mledu-datasets/cats_and_dogs_filtered.zip for this work
Dataset has been derived into training and validation pieces already . Hence we nedd to keep those datasets in two separete folders.
